##Akenge Custom CC3200 Bootloader

This project is a customised bootloader for the Texas Instruments CC3200 MCU.

The intention is to use this as the base for the development of a more complex Over-The-Air update system and enable features in the bootloader such as image files checksum and the execution of signed firmware only.

For a more detailed insight in the project, see the documentation pointed by documentation.html.
